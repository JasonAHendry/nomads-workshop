# nomads-workshop
A collection of bioinformatics workshops built for the NOMADS project.

## Getting started

In order to get started you will have to install `git` and `conda`. 

1. Go [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and follow the installation instructions appropriate for your operating system to install `git`.
2. Go [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/download.html) to download `conda`. I would recommend downloading the `Miniconda` version that is appropriate for your operating system. Choose the version that uses Python 3.
