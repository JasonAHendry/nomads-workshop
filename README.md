# nomads-workshop
A collection of bioinformatics workshops built for the NOMADS project.

## Getting started

In order to get started you will have to install `git` and `conda`. 

1. Go [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and follow the installation instructions appropriate for your operating system to install `git`.
2. Go [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/download.html) to download `conda`. I would recommend downloading the `Miniconda` version that is appropriate for your operating system. Choose the version that uses Python 3.

Once you have completed steps 1. and 2., you should be able to clone this repository and install the conda environment. Using terminal, navigate to a folder where you keep your bioinformatics projects. Then type:

```
git clone https://github.com/JasonAHendry/fwd-dream.git
cd nomads-workshop
conda env create
```

Now you will have download all the code and installed all the dependencies required for the workshops.
